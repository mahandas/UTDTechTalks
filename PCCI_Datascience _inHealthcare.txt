PCCI :
# Health care data quality - human intervention - poor quality data

# data quality checks needed
in dev: NLP on doctor notes to check human intervention and prediction/checking of prescribed desease.

#Socio economic factors are open source:
1. Criminal data
2. social conditions

# does it account the care providers bias?{practioner)
Workflows - predictory model - creates a safe area- precision 
-Clinical pilot testing (feedback)
-Tuning is required to the existing models

#breaches cant be managed - no opensource is used 

# data is crunched into ML jobs to prevent risk from data leaks 

Industry questions
#HIPAA rules:  Healthcare information Compliance
#EPIC healthcare
#EMR 

#Error in AI - is it viable to be used in healthcare which is a very sensitive sector??

Ethical and explainable AI - if something happens can they explain what happened- is the data unbiased
Approach <> Workflows <> Platform

-------------
Approach:

Timly clinical factors > timely socio economic factors ( asking teachers, air quality, etc) > 

-------------
 Data:
Healthcare
SDoh
Genomics

Analytics:
Predictive
Pescriptive
AI

These can be integrated into IOT, rights are explained, staff is present ( oncologists with a  data scientist to make models around data)
------------------------

Word of mouth is used to market amongst doctors
-------------------------
Sensors are not part yet - expected sensors : air quality sensor, gluclometer
----------------------
Major source of data :
Clinical data, socio economical data
----------------------
Model only on PCCI will not work on other countries. (~2.5million records)
----------------
QA
Are data involving continuous feedback from a particular patient recorded (change of lifestyle, working of prescrived drugs, etc)?

------------------

Are any financal model used in PCCI ? does this help the patient of the hospital?
_not yet
---------------------

USP - Team of doctors and data scientist to tune models, rigorous testing EMR, score with pop up of the trend graph is maintained.
Feedback Loop is implemented in the entire workflow
